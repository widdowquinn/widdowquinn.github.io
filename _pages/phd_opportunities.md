The PhD studentship projects listed below are currently available. Please do read our [advice for potential PhD students](/phd/prospective_students), if you are considering an application. 

## Project 1: Comprehensive taxonomy, pangenomics and metabolic modelling of *Streptomyces*.

### Aim 1: Develop a robust taxonomic classification of the *Streptomyces* genus

Generate an objective and definitive classification scheme for *Streptomyces*, which is essential for meaningful comparative genomic and pangenome analysis, and for comparison of whole-genome models.

### Aim 2: Pangenome analysis of *Streptomyces*

Produce a definitive pangenome analysis for *Streptomyces*, using the classification scheme developed in Aim 1, to elucidate the evolutionary history of the genus, and to underpin genome mining of secondary metabolite synthetic clusters. This will link to a BBSRC TRDF proposal (LP, [Dr Kate Duncan](https://www.strath.ac.uk/staff/duncankatherinedr/), [Dr Simon Rogers](http://www.dcs.gla.ac.uk/~srogers/) [Glasgow]) to develop the NPLINKER resource for prediction of secondary metabolite structure from genomic sequence. The data generated in this objective can directly inform development of kernel-based methods for associating BGC sequence with the product metabolite mass spectra in NPLINKER.

### Aim 3: Whole-genome metabolic modelling of *Streptomyces*

Generate whole-genome metabolic models for key *Streptomyces* groups identified in Aims 1 and 2, to support engineering potential and genome mining for BGCs. Extend these models to incorporate gene-protein-reaction rules to incorporate â€˜omic datasets for realistic biological constraints. This work will additionally link to a BBSRC proposal (LP, PH, [Dr Nick Tucker](https://www.strath.ac.uk/staff/tuckernicholasdr/)) that aims to reconstruct whole-genome regulatory networks from *Streptomyces*.
