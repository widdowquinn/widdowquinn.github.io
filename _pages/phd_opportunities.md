The group has no funded PhD studentships available at the moment, but please do come back to this page to check for future opportunities.

Although we don't have any funded studentships available, we are able to host self-funded students. Please email Leighton to enquire further.

Please do read our [advice for potential PhD students](/phd/prospective_students), if you are considering an application.
