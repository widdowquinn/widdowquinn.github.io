## Weekly reports

Weekly reports are a way to report what group members have been up to; this provides both Leighton and the group member with context and trajectory going forward, and means that in-person meetings can focus on specific issues rather than be more general reporting. Weekly reports can be emailed to Leighton privately or to the whole lab.

Weekly reports can and should be minimalist - basically, list

- what you’ve been working on for the lab, including progress made and obstacles overcome;
- deferred items and upcoming issues;
- long term goals;
- work-related travel;
- anything else you want Leighton to know, including personal issues;

If most of the weekly report can be copy-pasted from the previous week, feel free to do so. If it takes you more than 60 minutes to do each week, you’re probably overthinking it.
