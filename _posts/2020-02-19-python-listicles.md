The [RealPython](https://realpython.com/) Python training website has two listicles of their top 10 Python books, and top 10 PyCon talks.

- [Top 10 Books](https://realpython.com/best-python-books/)
- [Top 10 PyCon Videos](https://realpython.com/must-watch-pycon-talks/)

The articles are worth reading as they have detailed reviews but, for the impatient, the lists are summarised below. Leighton has some of these books in the office so please let him know if you'd like to borrow them. He also gets a discount from [No Starch Press](https://nostarch.com), if you'd like to buy a copy for yourself.
